      Refund Policy
    </h1>

    <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">
      At MMVALI Farm, we care about customer satisfaction and product quality.
      This refund policy explains when and how refunds or replacements are
      provided for dairy products purchased from us.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">1. Eligibility for Refund or Replacement</h2>
    <p>
      Refunds or replacements may be considered in cases where:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
      <li>The product is damaged or spoiled at the time of delivery.</li>
      <li>An incorrect product was delivered compared to your order.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">2. Reporting an Issue</h2>
    <p>
      Any issue must be reported within 24 hours of delivery. Please contact us
      with details of the problem and, if possible, share photos of the product
      and packing.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">3. Verification Process</h2>
    <p>
      All refund or replacement requests are subject to verification by MMVALI
      Farm. We reserve the right to approve or decline a request based on the
      facts and evidence provided.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">4. Refund Method</h2>
    <p>
      Approved refunds may be processed through the original mode of payment or
      via an alternative method, such as credit for a future order, as mutually
      agreed with the customer.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">5. Non-Refundable Situations</h2>
    <p>
      We may not be able to offer a refund or replacement if:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
      <li>The product has been consumed partially or fully.</li>
      <li>The product was stored improperly after delivery.</li>
      <li>The issue is reported much later than the stated time window.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-6 mb-2">6. Policy Changes</h2>
    <p>
      MMVALI Farm reserves the right to modify this refund policy at any time
      without prior notice. Please review this page periodically for updates.
